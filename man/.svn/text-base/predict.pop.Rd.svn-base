\description{
The function generates trajectories of probabilistic population projection for all countries of the world, or any subset of them.

\details{
The projection is generated sequentially country by country. Results are stored in a subdirectory of \code{output.dir} called \file{prediction}. They are updated every time a country projection is finished.

The population projection is computed using the Cohort Component method and is based on an algorithm used by the United Nation Population Division. For each country, one projection is calculated for each trajectory of male and female life expectancy and TFR. This results in a set of trajectories of population projection which forms its posterior distribution. The trajectories of life expectancy and TFR can be given either in its binary form generated by the packages bayesLife and bayesTFR, respectively (as directories \code{e0M.sim.dir}, \code{e0F.sim.dir}, \code{tfr.sim.dir} of the \code{inputs} argument), or they can be given as ASCII tables in csv format, see above.
