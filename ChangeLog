Restoring graphical pars in various plot functions
(thanks to Ludger Sandig for the patch)

Added new expression functions:
    mid.period - for population in the middle of time periods
    period.diff - difference between the end and beginning of time periods
    period.ratio - ratio of the end and beginning of time periods (e.g. annual growth rate: 100 * log(period.ratio(PQA))/5)
    
Removed dependency on the DemoTools package.

8.0-0 (06/18/2019)

Various bug fixes.

7.0-1 (04/02/2019)
-----
Fixed bug in writing summary for cases when projection is generated 
for one country only (thanks to Anna Janicka)

7.0-0 (10/11/2018)

Fixed an issue with PASFR when projecting beyond 2100. 

6.2-3 (10/22/2017)
-----
Replace NA values of historical population with 0. 
(In wpp2017 the open age group for years before 1990 is 85+ and thus the pop datasets are NA for old ages. This was problematic in various sum and plotting functions.)

-----
Added support for wpp2015.

Life table functions revisited. (Thomas Buettner)

Cohort deaths converted to period deaths. (Thomas Buettner)

Bug in present mortality rates fixed.

Added functions get.pop.ex and get.pop.exba for retrieving results of expressions.

input components (migration, TFR, e0). Called "get.trajectories.close.to".

5.4-0 (7/17/2014)
-----
A few fixes in adjustments.

Added function for creating an expression for the mean age of child-bearing, "mac.expression(country)".

pop.pyramidAll got a logical argument "one.file" for plotting everyhting into one file.

pop.trajectories.pyramid accepts now the "indicator" argument (analogous to pop.pyramid)
to plot deaths and births.  

Plotted trajectories are shown in a transparent color. Default colors of pop.pyramid 
changed (thanks to Tim Riffe).

Argument my.locations.file added to pop.predict to allow projections for other 
than the UN countries/regions (thanks to Filippo Temporin).

Aggregations for ASFR and PASFR implemented.

Added PASFR to write.pop.projection.summary.

Added functions for extracting and plotting cohort data 
(functions cohorts, pop.cohorts.plot)

Added functions pop.trajectories and get.trajectory.indices.

5.3-4 (4/10/2015)
-----
Projecting age-specific mortality:
	- dealt with jump-off bias - different way of computing a_x (country specific)
	- implemented rotation of b_x (Li, Gerland 2013)
	- some countries use modeled b_x

Implemented projection of percent age-specific fertility rate (Kantorova 2014)

Added 'R' into expressions for obtaining percent age-specific fertility.

plot.by.age got a few additional graphical arguments.

5.2-2 (2/4/2015)

5.2-0 (10/3/2014)
-----
Added an option of using projections of mx only, without calculating e0.

5.1-5 (8/13/2014)
-----
Minor fixes.

5.1-1 (5/9/2014)
-----
Time points for population indicators changed to end of time periods instead of the middle year.

Allowing adjustments to wpp2012 (in output functions as well as in pop.aggregate)

5.0-0 (4/28/2014)
-----
Allows probabilistic migration: trajectories of net counts can be passed in an csv file to pop.predict
(no re-balancing implemented yet).

If keep.vital.events is TRUE, the migration trajectories are stored with all the other country-specific data
and can be accessed using the "G" expression.
 
Aggregation 'method's changed to 'input.type' in pop.aggregate. Default input types are now 
'country' (former independence method) and 'region' (former regional method). 
Thus, default names of aggregation directories are aggregations_country and aggregations_region.

Updated dataset on migration type and year (vwBaseYear2012) [Patrick Gerland].

Stored bayesPop.prediction object slightly changed.

A column 'Trajectory' is now required for trajectories files of TFR, e0 and migration (if used).

In pop.predict the input elements [tfr|e0F|e0M].file accept the keyword "median_" to use the median WPP projection.
(Note that if nothing is given it takes the median, low and high as default.)

Example simulation re-computed with the new defaults.

Aggregation allowed for user-defined groups (argument my.location.file in pop.aggregate).

4.0-0 (5/20/2013)
-----
WPP data removed and put in separate packages (wpp2008, wpp2010). The package is now dependent on those.
