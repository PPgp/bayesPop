4.2-2 (12/2/2013)
-----
Function get.pop exposed to outside.

4.2-0/1 (10/10/2013)
-----
New expression function - pop.combine.

Changes in dependencies and imports.

4.1-0/1 (7/22/2013)
-----
Setting 2012 as new default for wpp year. Adding wpp2012 into dependencies.

Default input e0 and TFR in pop.predict are taken from the wpp package as three trajectories max.
Example simulation re-computed with the new defaults.

Aggregation allowed for user-defined groups (argument my.location.file in pop.aggregate).

4.0-0 (5/20/2013)
-----
WPP data removed and put in separate packages (wpp2008, wpp2010). The package is now dependent on those.



=========
Odd version numbers refer to versions containing full (confidential) UN data.
Even version numbers refer to versions containing reduced (public) UN data. 
===================================================
3.2-6 (4/19/2013)
-----
pop.map can processes expressions in parallel.

3.2-3/4 (4/10/2013)
-----
data are loaded into current environment.

3.2-1/2 (4/5/2013)
-----
.find.package replaced by find.package.

In expressions for M, Q and S, age groups 0-1, 1-4 and 0-4 are associated with indices -1, 0, 1, respectively.

3.2-0 (3/19/2012)
-----
Added mx, qx and migration to expressions.

Allowed using zero index for age group 0-1.

Functions LifeTableMx and LifeTableMxCol added.

Indicator added to pop.pyramid.

3.1-11 (2/16/2013)
------
Fixed an issue with NAs in TFR trajectories. 

3.1-9/10 (1/3/2013)
-----
.First.lib and .Last.lib changed to .onLoad and .onUnload

3.1-7/8 (12/16/2012)
-----
Registred global object LOCATIONS (using utils::globalVariables()).

3.1-5/6 (12/15/2012)
-----
Example data reduced to two countries.

3.1-3/4 (12/02/2012)
-----
Bug fixes in regional aggregation.

Function pop.byage.plotAll added.

Suggested packages added to DESCRIPTION.

3.1-1 (11/16/2012)
-----
Bug in get.pop fixed.

In write.pop.projection.summary, argument 'alias' splitted into 'file.suffix' and expression.label.

Kannisto method modified to use female-male joint estimation of its slope parameter -> therefore no crossovers in the extrapolated death rates.   

3.0-3 (10/14/2012)
-----
Male Mx for ages 100-130+ constrained to be larger than female Mx. Others no constraints.

3.0-1 (10/11/2012)
-----
Male Mx constrained to be larger than female Mx.

Functions for plotting and tabulating indicators by age (pop.byage.plot, pop.byage.table)

Functions for creating maps implemented (pop.map, pop.map.gvis). 

Expression language added for visualizing and summarizing any population measure using pop.trajectories.plot/table and map functions.

Caching mechanism added for time-efficient plotting of maps.

Storing vital events possible via pop.predict (argument keep.vital.events).

Implemented a function for writing a summary file for any population measure and stored vital events (write.pop.projection.summary).

2.0-1/2 (06/05/2012)
-----
S3 object and S3 methods for plotting pyramids. The pyramid functions completly re-implemented.

Trajectories pyramid can now show any number of years.

An argument 'aggregation' added to get.pop.prediction.

1.0-1 (05/17/2012)
-----
Aggregation added (function pop.aggregate).

In addition to projection years, population pyramids can now show a past year.

Option for including another year into the population pyramids (argument draw.past.year).


0.2-1/2 (04/12/2012)
-----
Integrated outputs from joint female-male life expectancy.

+/- half child variant added.

0.2-0 (11/17/2011)
-----
Initial version delivered to the UN population division.
