11.0-1/2 (02/21/2025)
------
Implemented new methods for disaggregating net migration into ages (FDM),
controlled by the argument mig.age.method in pop.predict and pop.predict.subnat.

New defaults for migration age-disaggregation (argument mig.age.method).

GQs can be defined by time.

Different Rogers-Castro schedules can be passed in for migration disaggregation
(argument mig.rc.fam in pop.predict and pop.predict.subnat).


10.0-2 (02/14/2025)
------
Added vwBaseYear2024 dataset.

Performance improvements in write.pop.projection.summary().

Incorporated use of 2024 migration dataset by age.

Fix in 1x1 GQs. 

Change in the syntax of the LatestAgeMortalityPattern column in vwBaseYear dataset.

Argument pasfr.ignore.phase2 added to pop.predict.subnat.

Additional steps for very young and very old child-bearing ages in

10.0-0/1 (08/09/2023)

pop.trajectories.plot: default for sum.over.ages changed to TRUE

Added argument xshift to  pop.trajectories.plot and pop.trajectories.table.

New mapping function, pop.ggmap(). 

Argument allow.negative.adj can be passed to write.pop.projection.summary() controlling

Option of giving migration inputs as rates.

Various functions now accept expressions that include "XXX", such as get.pop.ex() or get.pop.exba().

New function write.pop.trajectories() that exports trajectories for any expression, including by age and time.

Fixed bug related to extracting observed migration which did not work for aggregations 
(thanks to Crystal Yu).

Options for additional settings in the mortality pattern file (vwBaseYear):
    SmoothDFLatestAgeMortalityPattern (degree of freedom for smoothing)
    LatestAgeMortalityPattern can have 2 values (a negative for exclusion of latest time points and a positive for inclusion)
    AgeMortProjMethod1/2 can have value modPMD which uses a modified version of PMD (modPMD in MortCast) 
    
Added support for UN-based disaggregation into migration schedules (argument mig.age.method = "un" in pop.predict).
User-defined schedules are also possible (mig.age.method = "user").

9.0-0/1 (11/28/2021)
-------
Support for 1x1 projections (1 year age x 1 year time); still an experimental feature!
    - argument "annual" in pop.predict
    - age in expressions goes from 0 to 100 (observed) or to 130 (projected)
    - child-bearing ages expanded to 10-54 (only for 1x1 projections)
    - for subnational projections not yet supported!
    
The cohort component method modified so that it exactly reproduces the UN-implemented CCM (thanks to Sara Hertog for help).

A 5x5 projection can be generated using annual TFR and e0 inputs. They are then averaged.

Fixed bug in write.pop.projection.summary for "tpopage" (reported by Budi Setiawan).

The inputs argument in pop.predict and pop.predict.subnat accepts total migration (mig) or sex-specific total migration (migMt, migFt). The disaggregation into ages is done via Rogers-Castro.

Another new element of inputs argument in pop.predict and pop.predict.subnat is GQpopM and GQpopF which can be used to define group quarters, i.e. a part of the population that should be excluded from the cohort component method.

Support for the "psr" option in various functions removed as it can be derived using expressions.

Other mortality projection methods than Lee-Carter can be used in subnational projections (argument lc.for.all enabled).

Updates in bayesTFR now allow to define the argument "country" in various functions as ISO-2 or ISO-3 characters (pop.trajectories.plot, pop.pyramid, summary, etc)

New functions:
o project.pasfr - allows to generate PASFR outside of a bayesPop simulation
o migration.totals2age - disaggregates migration into ages
o mac.expression1 - generates an expression for the mean age of childbearing for a 1x1 projection
o rcastro.schedule - returns the default Rogers-Castro age distribution

8.1-3 (5/5/2020)
-----

(thanks to Ludger Sandig for the patch)

Added new expression functions:
    mid.period - for population in the middle of time periods
    period.diff - difference between the end and beginning of time periods
    period.ratio - ratio of the end and beginning of time periods (e.g. annual growth rate: 100 * log(period.ratio(PQA))/5)
    
Removed dependency on the DemoTools package.

8.0-0 (06/18/2019)
-----
Support for wpp2019.

pop.predict can run in parallel.

Age-specific mortality is now computed using MortCast functions.

Added mortality methods for PMD, HIVmortmod, LogQuad and blends of any two methods. Arguments lc.for.all and lc.for.hiv control if Lee-Carter is used (TRUE) or methods set in the vwBaseYear dataset. Added dependency on HIV.LifeTables.

Added aggregation of mortality rates. Added dependency on the DemoTools package.

Fixed an issue with PASFR when projecting beyond 2100. 

6.2-3 (10/22/2017)
-----
Replace NA values of historical population with 0. 
(In wpp2017 the open age group for years before 1990 is 85+ and thus the pop datasets are NA for old ages. This was problematic in various sum and plotting functions.)

to plot deaths and births.  

Plotted trajectories are shown in a transparent color. Default colors of pop.pyramid 
changed (thanks to Tim Riffe).

than the UN countries/regions (thanks to Filippo Temporin).

Aggregations for ASFR and PASFR implemented.

Added PASFR to write.pop.projection.summary.

Added functions for extracting and plotting cohort data 
(functions cohorts, pop.cohorts.plot)

Added functions pop.trajectories and get.trajectory.indices.

5.3-4 (4/10/2015)
-----
Projecting age-specific mortality:
	- dealt with jump-off bias - different way of computing a_x (country specific)
	- implemented rotation of b_x (Li, Gerland 2013)
	- some countries use modeled b_x

Implemented projection of percent age-specific fertility rate (Kantorova 2014)

Added 'R' into expressions for obtaining percent age-specific fertility.

5.0-0 (4/28/2014)
-----
Allows probabilistic migration: trajectories of net counts can be passed in an csv file to pop.predict
(no re-balancing implemented yet).

If keep.vital.events is TRUE, the migration trajectories are stored with all the other country-specific data
and can be accessed using the "G" expression.
 
Aggregation 'method's changed to 'input.type' in pop.aggregate. Default input types are now 
'country' (former independence method) and 'region' (former regional method). 
Thus, default names of aggregation directories are aggregations_country and aggregations_region.

Updated dataset on migration type and year (vwBaseYear2012) [Patrick Gerland].

Stored bayesPop.prediction object slightly changed.

A column 'Trajectory' is now required for trajectories files of TFR, e0 and migration (if used).

In pop.predict the input elements [tfr|e0F|e0M].file accept the keyword "median_" to use the median WPP projection.
(Note that if nothing is given it takes the median, low and high as default.)

Example simulation re-computed with the new defaults.

Aggregation allowed for user-defined groups (argument my.location.file in pop.aggregate).

4.0-0 (5/20/2013)
-----
WPP data removed and put in separate packages (wpp2008, wpp2010). The package is now dependent on those.
