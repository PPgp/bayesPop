9.0-0
-----
Support for 1x1 projections (1 year age x 1 year time); still an experimental feature!
    - argument "annual" in pop.predict
    - age in expressions goes from 0 to 100 (observed) or to 130 (projected)
    - child-bearing ages expanded to 10-54 (only for 1x1 projections)
    - for subnational projections not yet supported!
    
The cohort component method modified so that it exactly reproduces the UN-implemented CCM (thanks to Sara Hertog for help).

A 5x5 projection can be generated using annual TFR and e0 inputs. They are hen averaged.

Fixed bug in write.pop.projection.summary for "tpopage" (reported by Budi Setiawan).

The inputs argument in pop.predict and pop.predict.subnat accepts total migration (mig) or sex-specific total migration (migMt, migFt). The disaggregation into ages is done via Rogers-Castro.

Another new element of inputs argument in pop.predict and pop.predict.subnat is GQpopM and GQpopF which can be used to define group quarters, i.e. a part of the population that should be excluded from the cohort component method.

Support for the "psr" option in various functions removed as it can be derived using expressions.

Other mortality projection methods than Lee-Carter can be used in subnational projections (argument lc.for.all enabled).

Updates in bayesTFR now allow to define the argument "country" in various functions as ISO-2 or ISO-3 characters (pop.trajectories.plot, pop.pyramid, summary, etc)

New functions:
o project.pasfr - allows to generate PASFR outside of a bayesPop simulation
o migration.totals2age - disaggregates migration into ages
o mac.expression1 - generates an expression for the mean age of childbearing for a 1x1 projection
o rcastro.schedule - returns the default Rogers-Castro age distribution

8.1-3 (5/5/2020)
-----
Minor updates related to changes in MortCast.

8.1-2 (3/10/2020)
-----
Make get.survival function work also for one time period (reported by Budi Setiawan)

-----
Defaults set to use data from wpp2019.

Restoring graphical pars in various plot functions
(thanks to Ludger Sandig for the patch)

Added new expression functions:
    mid.period - for population in the middle of time periods
    period.diff - difference between the end and beginning of time periods
    period.ratio - ratio of the end and beginning of time periods (e.g. annual growth rate: 100 * log(period.ratio(PQA))/5)
    
Removed dependency on the DemoTools package.

8.0-0 (06/18/2019)
-----
Support for wpp2019.

Age-specific mortality is now computed using MortCast functions.

Added mortality methods for PMD, HIVmortmod, LogQuad and blends of any two methods. Arguments lc.for.all and lc.for.hiv control if Lee-Carter is used (TRUE) or methods set in the vwBaseYear dataset. Added dependency on HIV.LifeTables.

Added aggregation of mortality rates. Added dependency on the DemoTools package.

Various bug fixes.

7.0-1 (04/02/2019)

Fixed an issue with PASFR when projecting beyond 2100. 

6.2-3 (10/22/2017)
-----
Replace NA values of historical population with 0. 
(In wpp2017 the open age group for years before 1990 is 85+ and thus the pop datasets are NA for old ages. This was problematic in various sum and plotting functions.)

-----
A few fixes in adjustments.

Added function for creating an expression for the mean age of child-bearing, "mac.expression(country)".

pop.pyramidAll got a logical argument "one.file" for plotting everyhting into one file.

to plot deaths and births.  

Plotted trajectories are shown in a transparent color. Default colors of pop.pyramid 
changed (thanks to Tim Riffe).

than the UN countries/regions (thanks to Filippo Temporin).

Aggregations for ASFR and PASFR implemented.

Added PASFR to write.pop.projection.summary.

Added functions for extracting and plotting cohort data 
(functions cohorts, pop.cohorts.plot)

Added functions pop.trajectories and get.trajectory.indices.

5.3-4 (4/10/2015)
-----
Projecting age-specific mortality:
	- dealt with jump-off bias - different way of computing a_x (country specific)
	- implemented rotation of b_x (Li, Gerland 2013)
	- some countries use modeled b_x

Implemented projection of percent age-specific fertility rate (Kantorova 2014)

Added 'R' into expressions for obtaining percent age-specific fertility.

5.0-0 (4/28/2014)
-----
Allows probabilistic migration: trajectories of net counts can be passed in an csv file to pop.predict
(no re-balancing implemented yet).

If keep.vital.events is TRUE, the migration trajectories are stored with all the other country-specific data
and can be accessed using the "G" expression.
 
Aggregation 'method's changed to 'input.type' in pop.aggregate. Default input types are now 
'country' (former independence method) and 'region' (former regional method). 
Thus, default names of aggregation directories are aggregations_country and aggregations_region.

Updated dataset on migration type and year (vwBaseYear2012) [Patrick Gerland].

Stored bayesPop.prediction object slightly changed.

A column 'Trajectory' is now required for trajectories files of TFR, e0 and migration (if used).

In pop.predict the input elements [tfr|e0F|e0M].file accept the keyword "median_" to use the median WPP projection.
(Note that if nothing is given it takes the median, low and high as default.)

-----
pop.aggregate can handle any number of overlapping aggregations in the location file.

Example simulation re-computed with the new defaults.

Aggregation allowed for user-defined groups (argument my.location.file in pop.aggregate).

4.0-0 (5/20/2013)
-----
WPP data removed and put in separate packages (wpp2008, wpp2010). The package is now dependent on those.
